## Try It Out

Hit **Run** to start `interface.py`.

Play through the game once. Pay close attention to how it *feels* — especially the start screen, the score display, and the game over screen.

**Be a critic:**
- Start screen: Does it tell you what to do? What the game is about?
- During play: Can you easily see your score? Is it in a useful place?
- Game over: Is it clear? Satisfying? Does it feel like an ending?

Make a list of at least **3 things** that could be improved.
