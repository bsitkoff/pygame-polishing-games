## Create Your Own

Apply what you've noticed to your own game. Think about:

- Can a new player tell what the game is about from the start screen?
- Is the score easy to read? Is it in a useful place?
- Are your sprites a good size for the game area?
- Does the game over screen tell the player what happened and what to do next?
- Does adding a background image change how the game feels?

Make at least three visible improvements.

### 🎥 Record Your Design Explanation

When you're happy with your changes, record a **2–3 minute video** using **Screencastify Submit** explaining:

1. What you changed and why
2. One design choice you're proud of
3. One thing you'd still improve if you had more time

You're not explaining how the *code* works — you're explaining your *design decisions*.

**Submit through Screencastify Submit when done.**

### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

*Need a custom image? Here's the workflow — or rewatch the video from Lesson 1.*

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels**
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)**, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not bigger — always start with a large enough image)*
3. Upload to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Update the `Actor` name in your code to match the filename (no extension)
