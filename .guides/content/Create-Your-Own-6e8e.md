## Create Your Own

Apply what you've noticed to your own game. Open `tryit.py` — this is your game from Lesson 4, ready to polish.

**Think about:**
- Can a new player tell what the game is about from the start screen?
- Is the score easy to read? Is it in a useful place?
- Are your sprites a good size for the game area?
- Does the game over screen tell the player what happened?

### Make a Design Video

When your game looks the way you want it, use **Screencastify Submit** to record a short video (1–2 minutes) explaining your design choices.

In your video, show:
1. The start screen — what does it communicate?
2. Gameplay — what did you change and why?
3. Game over — what's your design intention here?
