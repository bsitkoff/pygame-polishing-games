## Change It

Now fix the problems you identified. Work in `interface.py`.

**Design goals — aim for at least 3:**

1. **Start screen**: Add a title. Tell the player what to do (e.g., "Press SPACE to start"). Add color.
2. **Score display**: Move it somewhere visible. Make the font bigger. Try a contrasting color.
3. **Game over screen**: Show the final score. Make "Game Over" actually readable — size, color, placement.
4. **Background**: Try a color that makes your sprites stand out. Or add a visual theme.
5. **Sprite sizing**: Are sprites a comfortable size for the play area? Too big? Too small?

**Design principle to keep in mind:**

*The player should never have to wonder what to do next.* Every screen should answer: "What is this? What do I do?"
