## Playtest and Reflect

Share your polished game with a neighbor. This time, watch them play — don't give hints.

**Observe:**
- Where do they hesitate or get confused?
- Did your start screen communicate what to do?
- Was there anything they noticed that you didn't intend?

---

**Reflect:**

Game designers call this "playtesting." What's one thing you'd change based on watching someone play your game?
