## Get Ready

*This is a design extension — no new code syntax to learn. The goal is to make your game feel better to play.*

You've got a working game. But does it look good? Does a new player know what to do? Does the score feel satisfying? 

Good game design isn't just about what works — it's about what players *experience*. In this lesson you'll look at a deliberately rough game, figure out what's wrong with it, and improve it. Then you'll do the same for your own game.

**When you're done, you'll make a short video explaining the design choices you made.**

*No video to watch — the activity is the instruction.*

*Content coming soon.*
